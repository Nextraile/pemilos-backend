/**
 * Sanitizes user input for MongoDB regex queries to prevent NoSQL injection attacks.
 * 
 * SECURITY RATIONALE:
 * MongoDB regex queries using $regex can be exploited if user input contains special regex characters.
 * 
 * ATTACK EXAMPLE:
 * Without sanitization, an attacker could inject: ".*" to match all users,
 * or use "^a.*" to enumerate users starting with 'a' for reconnaissance.
 * More sophisticated attacks could use regex complexity to cause ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).
 * 
 * PROTECTION MECHANISM:
 * Escapes all regex metacharacters: . * + ? ^ $ { } ( ) | [ ] \
 * Each special char is prefixed with backslash to treat it as literal text.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input:  "user.*@example"
 * Output: "user\\.\\*@example"
 * This searches for the literal string "user.*@example" instead of a regex pattern.
 * 
 * @param input - Raw user input string that will be used in a MongoDB $regex query
 * @returns Sanitized string with all regex special characters escaped

/**
 * Retrieves all users with dynamic filtering and pagination.
 * 
 * BUSINESS LOGIC FLOW:
 * 1. Calculate pagination offset based on page number (100 records per page)
 * 2. Build dynamic query object based on provided filters
 * 3. Execute MongoDB query with filters, pagination, and field selection
 * 4. Return array of matching user documents
 * 
 * PAGINATION STRATEGY:
 * - Fixed page size: 100 users per page
 * - Offset-based pagination: skip = (page - 1) * 100
 * - Page 1: records 0-99, Page 2: records 100-199, etc.
 * 
 * QUERY BUILDING LOGIC:
 * - role: Always required (defaults to 'voter')
 * - name: Case-insensitive partial match using sanitized regex
 * - class: Optional - only added to query if provided
 * - isVoted: Optional - only added to query if explicitly set (true/false)
 * 
 * SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE: Password field is exposed in response (line 102)
 * - Passwords should NEVER be returned in API responses, even if hashed
 * - Attackers can use exposed hashes for offline cracking attempts
 * - RECOMMENDATION: Remove 'password' from .select() projection
 * 
 * NoSQL INJECTION PREVENTION:
 * - sanitizeRegex() escapes special regex chars in name filter
 * - Prevents attackers from injecting regex patterns to:
 *   1. Enumerate all users with ".*"
 *   2. Perform reconnaissance with patterns like "^admin.*"
 *   3. Cause ReDoS attacks with complex nested patterns
